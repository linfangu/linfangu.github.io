🌟 **Bridging neuroscience and AI**

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Bioengineering at [UCLA](https://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/), mentored by [Dr. Weizhe Hong (Neurobiology)](https://www.hong-lab.org/) and [Dr. Jonathan Kao (Computer Science/ECE)](https://www.kaolab.org/). My research sits at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, where I use machine learning (deep reinforcement learning) to study the computational principles underlying brain function. By grounding AI models in biological principles, I also develop artificial agents with enhanced cooperation and adaptive decision-making capabilities.

Previously, I earned my bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, where I worked with [Dr. Gedi Luksys](https://discovery-brain-sciences.ed.ac.uk/our-staff/research-groups/gedi-luksys) on machine learning decoding of emotion and memory from human neuroimaging data, and with [Prof. Ge Bai](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/bailab) on the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.

Looking ahead, I aim to apply **artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning** to develop **adaptive brain–computer interfaces, precise neural modulation technologies, and brain imaging analyses** for the detection and treatment of neurological disorders.

🌟 **Bridging scientists and the community**

Science communication has shaped my academic and personal growth, allowing me to engage diverse audiences and support community dialogue. I have contributed to initiatives at UCLA’s Brain Research Institute, Pint of Science, and the Inner Circle, taking on leadership roles that foster community dialogue.
