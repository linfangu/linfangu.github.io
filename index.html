<p> I’m a fourth-year PhD student in Bioengineering at the University of California, Los Angeles, where I work in the laboratory of Prof. Weizhe Hong. My research is driven by an interest in understanding how teamwork and social communication function under stressful or rewarding environment. To explore this, I use a multidisciplinary approach that combines animal training, neural recording, and AI to investigate the neural mechanisms behind social behavior. </p> 
<p> Beyond the lab, I’m passionate about cross-cultural communication and building meaningful connections between scientists and the broader community. I organize and host events aimed at making scientific research truly accessible, inclusive, and engaging—because I believe science should serve the public and respond to its needs. </p>
<p> I am always looking forward to exploring research ideas through cross-disciplinary lenses and learning new ways to serve the community. My email is linfangu@ucla.edu, please reach out! </p>
