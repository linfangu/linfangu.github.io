🌟 **Bridging neuroscience and AI**

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Bioengineering at UCLA, working with Dr. Weizhe Hong (Neurobiology) and Dr. Jonathan Kao (Computer Science/ECE). I am fortunate to be part of an interdisciplinary team investigating the computational foundations of neural systems and developing AI models with biologically grounded properties.

Previously, I earned my bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, where I worked with Dr. Gedi Luksys on emotional and valence representations in human neuroimaging data, and with Prof. Ge Bai on the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.

Looking ahead, I aim to apply artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning to develop brain–computer interfaces and precise neural modulation technologies for the treatment of neurological disorders.

🌟 **Bridging scientists and the community**

Science communication has shaped my academic and personal growth, allowing me to engage diverse audiences and support community dialogue. I have contributed to initiatives at UCLA’s Brain Research Institute, Pint of Science, and Inner Circle, taking on leadership roles that foster community dialogue.
