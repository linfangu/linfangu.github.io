🌟 I study the computational principles of the brain and how they give rise to complex behavior.

🌟 I develop brain-inspired artificial intelligence systems designed to collaborate with humans.

🌟 I am passionate about science communication and have taken on multiple roles in community events focused on health and technology, engaging diverse audiences.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Bioengineering at UCLA, working with Dr. Weizhe Hong (Neurobiology) and Dr. Jonathan Kao (Computer Science). My work sits at the intersection of neuroscience and deep learning, where I am fortunate to be part of an interdisciplinary team investigating the computational foundations of neural systems and developing AI models with biologically grounded properties.

Previously, I earned my bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, where I worked with Dr. Gedi Luksys on emotional and valence representations in human neuroimaging data, and with Prof. Ge Bai on the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.

Looking ahead, I aim to apply artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning to develop precise brain–computer interfaces and neural modulation technologies for the treatment of neurological disorders.
